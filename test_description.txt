Testing robot navigation web application

Purpose and goal:
Create test cases to test common web app usage, detect and log maximum errors
and useful information

Note: because of time limitations, I didn't finish everything what should be done,
but did just minimum to show possible way.

Steps:
- Login to app
- Edit the map:
    Add nodes
    Delete nodes
    Add edges
- Log out
- Verify app works as expected
- Output console logs.
